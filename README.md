# Kompacter

### A URL shortener app made with love and Rails (WIP)

Who knew you can create shorter links and get data from the people who clicks on them!
Yeap! that is what kompacter does
You can create an account and save your very own links and watch your numbers grow!

Using Ruby 2.7.2
You may run it locally or deploy it.

To Run it

1 Clone the project

1 I recommend you use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) and install ruby 2.7.2 `rvm install 2.7.2`

1 cd into project then `bundle install`

1 then simply `rails s`

1 go check your port 3000 on localhost and watch the magic begin
